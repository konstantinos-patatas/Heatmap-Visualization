# üå°Ô∏è Java Swing Heatmap Visualizer

This project is a **Java Swing-based GUI application** that visualizes temperature data as a **heatmap**. It was developed as part of the **CE152 Object-Oriented Programming** module at the **University of Essex** during my first year of study. It marked my first experience building a desktop GUI application using Java Swing and served as a practical introduction to file handling, data visualization, and custom component rendering in Java.

## üìà Project Overview

The application reads a data file containing **latitude**, **longitude**, and **temperature** values (in Fahrenheit), normalizes the coordinates to fit a drawing area within a `JFrame`, and visualizes the data as a heatmap using a **color gradient**.

### üñºÔ∏è Core Functionality

- **Custom Paint Component:** A `JComponent` is used to render a pixel-based heatmap from the normalized coordinates and temperature values.
- **Color Mapping:** Temperatures are mapped to colors using either a **color gradient** (warm to cool) or **grayscale**, enhancing readability.
- **Zoom Controls:** Users can zoom in or out to analyze specific areas of the heatmap.
- **Display Mode Toggle:** Switch between **colored** and **grayscale** visualizations for accessibility and contrast.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üé® **Java Swing GUI**: Built an interactive and user-friendly desktop interface.
- üñåÔ∏è **Custom Paint Rendering**: Rendered temperature points as connected rectangles for smooth visualization.
- üìÅ **File Handling**: Parsed structured temperature data from external `.csv` files.
- üåà **Color Gradients**: Visualized temperature data using dynamic gradient or grayscale mappings.
- üîç **Zooming Controls**: Allowed users to zoom in/out on specific data regions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Fixes

Here are some potential problems you might encounter when running the application, along with solutions:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ File Not Found Error

**Problem:**  
You may see an error like `FileNotFoundException` when the application tries to read the temperature data file.

**Fix:**  
- Open `TemperatureApp.java`
- Locate the line where the `TemperatureData` object is initialized (e.g., `new TemperatureData("heatmap.csv")`)
- Ensure the file path is correct
  - If the file is in the root directory of your project, use `"heatmap.csv"`
  - Otherwise, provide the **full absolute path** or correct **relative path**
- You can also **copy the full path** from your file system or project properties and paste it into the code.

> ‚úÖ Tip: If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, right-click the file > *Copy Path* to avoid typos.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using a Custom Data File

**Problem:**  
If you want to use your own `.csv` file and the app crashes or renders incorrectly, the file format may be invalid.

**Fix:**  
Make sure your file follows the correct structure. Each line should contain:
